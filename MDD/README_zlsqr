README for lsqrf90-v2

The software for LSQR (f90 version 2) is provided by SOL, Stanford University

24 Sep 2007: Version 2 of f90 files for LSQR.
             Separate modules are used for LSQR, example test problems,
             and Check routines for A and x.

             LSQR lives in lsqrModule.f90.
             Aprod1, Aprod2 (matrix-vector product routines) are in
             lsqrTestModule.f90.  This module illustrates how
             problem-specific data can be created for Aprod1, Aprod2
             even though LSQR calls them with a simple parameter list.
             
24 Sep 2007: f90 files available for download from SOL.
19 Dec 2008: lsqrblasInterface module implemented.
26 Oct 2012: lsqrTestProgram outputs helpful info to the screen.
29 Jun 2013: Support for complex A and b

LSQR (f90 version 2) involves the following files:

   lsqrblas.f90         (not needed if Level 1 BLAS are available)
   lsqrblasInterface.f90
   lsqrCheckModule.f90
   lsqrModule.f90
   lsqrTestModule.f90
   lsqrTestProgram.f90
   LSQR.txt             (example output file from an Apple iMac 
                         compiled with gfortran -g -O on Mac OS X 10.6.8)
   Makefile

To compile the code and run the test program on Linux or Unix,
proceed as follows:

   make lsqr               (creates executable TestProgram)
   ./TestProgram
   grep appears LSQR.txt

"LSQR  appears to be successful" should occur 17 times.
"LSQR  appears to have failed" might occur for the most
ill-conditioned problem, but this is not cause for alarm
if ||A'r|| is very small (~= 1e-12).

zLSQR is LSQR for complex A and complex b.  zLSQR involves the
following files:
   zlsqrblas.f90         (not needed if Level 1 BLAS are available)
   zlsqrblasInterface.f90
   zlsqrCheckModule.f90
   zlsqrModule.f90
   zlsqrTestModule.f90
   zlsqrTestProgram.f90
   zLSQR.txt             (example output file from an Apple iMac 
                          compiled with gfortran -g -O on Mac OS X 10.6.8)
   lsqrDataModule.f90
   Makefile

To compile the code and run the test program on Linux or Unix,
proceed as follows:

   make zlsqr               (creates executable zTestProgram)
   ./zTestProgram
