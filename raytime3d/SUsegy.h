 Export Restriction Disclaimer:
 We believe that CWP/SU: Seismic Un*x is a low technology product that does
 not appear on the Department of Commerce CCL list of restricted exports.
 Accordingly, we believe that our product meets the qualifications of
 an ECCN (export control classification number) of EAR99 and we believe
 it fits the qualifications of NRR (no restrictions required), and
 is thus not subject to export restrictions of any variety.
