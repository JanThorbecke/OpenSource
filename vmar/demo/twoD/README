Description of files:
1) model.scr computes the model
NOTE: 2 and 3 are only required if you have not previously ran the twoD demo in the marchenko folder! 
If you have previously run this demo use:
ln -s ../../../marchenko/demo/twoD/shots/ . 
and skip to 4
2a) shots_slurm/pbs.scr creates the shots and submit jobs to slurm or PBS
2b) check.scr after the jobs on shots_*.scr are finished checks if all shots are there
3a) direct.scr creates the direct arrival to be removed from the shots
3b) remove_direct.scr remove the direct wave from the shots 

NOTE: vmar can solve both the conventional Marchenko (Wapenaar et al., 2014) as well as the projected Marchenko (van der Neut & Wapenaar, 2016) algorithms, 

Projected Marchenko scripts (U and v):
4a) prepare_Uv.scr constructs initial focus (vp0.su) and mute windows A and B (WinA.su, WinB.su)
5a) marchenko_Uv.scr appends the reflection response with zeros (refl_rp.su) and preforms the projected Marchenko iterative scheme (Um.su, Up.su, vm.su, vp.su)

Conventional Marchenko scripts (G and f):
4b) prepare_Gf.scr constructs initial focus (fp0.su) and mute window C (WinC.su)
5b) marchenko_Gf.scr appends the reflection response with zeros (refl_rp.su) and preforms the conventional Marchenko iterative scheme (Gm.su, Gp.su, fm.su, fp.su)

NOTE: the vmar scripts requires the focusing functions and mute windows to have both the acausal and causal parts.
Whereas the reflection data is purely causal with the same number of samples. All outputs contain both the acausal and causal part.
