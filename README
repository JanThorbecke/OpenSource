INSTALLATION
-------------

1) To compile and link the code you first have to set the ROOT variable in the Make_include file which can be found in the directory where you have found this README.

2) Check the compiler and CFLAGS options in the file Make_include and adapt to the system you are using. The default options are set for a the GNU C-compiler on a Linux system. A Fortran or C++ compiler are not needed to compile the code. The Makefile has been tested with GNU make. 

3) If the compiler options are set in the Make_include file you can type 

> make 

and the Makefile will make:

- FFT library 
- fdelmodc
- marchenko
- utils

The libraries will be placed in the lib/ directory and the executables in the bin/ directory.

To use the executables don't forget to include the pathname in your PATH:

bash/sh:
export PATH='path_to_this_directory'/bin:$PATH:
csh:
setenv PATH 'path_to_this_directory'/bin:$PATH:

*** FOR SU USERS:
If you want to use the .su files with SU from CWP:
==> Please make sure that SU is compiled without XDR (in $CWPROOT/Makefile.config make sure that XDRFLAG is NOT set). The SU output files of fdelmodc are all based on local IEEE data.
*** 

> make clean

Finite Difference Modeling: FDELMODC
------------------------------------
If the compilation has finished without errors and produced an executable called bin/fdelmodc you can run one of the demo programs by running

> ./fdelmodc_plane.scr

in the directory fdelmodc/demo/ 

The demo directory contains scripts which demonstrate the different possibilities of the modeling program. 

To reproduce the Figures shown in the GEOPHYICS manuscript "Finite-difference modeling experiments for seismic interferometry" the scripts in FiguresPaper directory can be used. Please read the README in the FiguresPaper directory for more instructions and guidelines. 


Marchenko method : MARCHENKO
----------------------------
If the compilation has finished without errors and produced an executable called bin/marchenko you can run one of the demo programs by running

> ./

in the directory marchenko/demo/oneD

To reproduce the Figures shown in the GEOPHYICS manuscript "Implementation of the Marchenko method" the scripts in marchenko/demo/oneD directory can be used. Please read the README in the FiguresPaper directory for more instructions and guidelines. 


MISC
----
Other make commands which can be useful:

make clean : removes all object files, but leaves libraries and executables
make realclean: removes also object files, libraries and executables.


UPDATES AND LATEST VERSION
--------------------------
The latest version of the source code and manual can be found at:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~janth/Software/Software.html

 or at github:

git clone https://github.com/JanThorbecke/OpenSource.git

The code is used by many different people and if there is a request for a new option in the code, then I will try to implement, test and make it available.
