The scripts in this directory reproduce most of the pictures used in the manual. The Figure numbers below refer to the Figures in the manual

All scripts use some commands from Seismic Unix (SU) to plot results or post-process the data. 

==> Please make sure that SU is compiled without XDR (In $CWPROOT/Makefile.config make sure that XDRFLAG is NOT set). The SU output files of fdelmodc are base on local IEEE data.
