The scripts in this directory reproduce the Figures shown in the paper "Finite-difference modeling experiments for seismic interferometry". Some of those scripts take a very long time to run. In this file some guidelines and runtime indications are given of the scripts to reproduce the Figures. The runtimes are given for a 2.5 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo. OpenMP parallelization is not used.

All scripts use some commands from Seismic Unix (SU) to plot results or post-process the data. 

==> Please make sure that SU is compiled without XDR (In $CWPROOT/Makefile.config make sure that XDRFLAG is NOT set). The SU output files of fdelmodc are base on local IEEE data. 



Figure2.scr
-------------
starts fdelmodc only to compute the source positions, 1 s.
runtime: 5 seconds

Figure3.scr
-------------
First the shots along the box-shaped contour are modeled for each shot separately. This takes a very long time. To model these shots two other script are called:

Simple_model_base.scr, to model 900 shots at level z=3600
Simple_model_sides.scr, to model 2x360 shots at the sides of the model at x=1000 and x=9000
runtime one shot: 270 seconds. 
total runtime modeling: 122 hours.

Figure3_ref.scr
-------------
direct modeled reference result Figure 3d
runtime: 500 seconds.

Figure4.scr
-------------
5 different source signature lengths
Runtime: 3.5 hours per shot of 120 s. modeling

Figure5.scr
-------------
simulates 8000 short (2.5 s) sources
Runtime: 3.5 hours

Figure6.scr
-------------
5 different number of random sources
Runtime: 3.5 hours per shot of 120 s. modeling

Figure6f.scr
-------------
make postscript file of middle trace after Figure6.scr, 1 s.
Runtime: a few seconds to produce the figure.
The script Figure6.scr must be run first

Figure6length.scr
-------------
NOT used in paper: The same as script Figure6.scr, but a random source signature of a fixed length. 

Figure7.scr
-------------
as Figure 6, but with 1000 deep sources
Runtime: 3.5 hours

Figure7length.scr
-------------
NOT used in paper: The same as script Figure7.scr, but a random source signature of a fixed length. 

Figure7fmax.scr
-------------
NOT used in paper: The same as script Figure7.scr, but with varying maximum frequency in source signature.

Figure8-9.scr
-------------
for random and ricker wavelet deep, volume and plane sources
Runtime: 6 x 3.5 hours

Figure8-9Hom.scr
-------------
for reviewer, same as Fig. 8-9 in homogeneous medium
NOT used in paper: to answers reviewer, same as fig 8-9 in homogeneous medium,
Runtime: 6 x 3.5 hours

Figure10.scr
-------------
reference and 2 SI results for visco-acoustic media
Runtime reference: 2 x 3 minutes 
Runtime deep and volume: 2 x 1.5 hours  

Figure11.scr
----------- 
Uses the result of fdelmodc_long.scr and produces the postscript figures.

The program to compute the correlation in a continuous way (corrsmp) is missing and the correlation result can not be reproduced. The program corrsmp is still in a development state and not yet suited for release. 

Figure12.scr
-------------
The program to compute the correlation in a continuous way (corrsmp) is missing and the correlation result can not be reproduced. The program corrsmp is still in a development state and not yet suited for release. 

Figure13.scr
-------------
amplitude variations on source strength
Runtime: 3 x 1500 s.

Figure14-15.scr
-------------
The reference shot can be reproduced, together with the long 3600 s modeling. The SI retrieved results can not be reproduced.
runtime: 161 hours for the 3600 seconds passive measurement

61 output files will be created each containing 65535 time samples. 

The program to compute the correlation in a continuous way (corrsmp) is missing and the correlation result can not be reproduced. The program corrsmp is still in a development state and not yet suited for release. 


FigureSourcesAppendixA.scr
-------------
source construction shown in Figure A2-A3-A4
runtime: 150 seconds


FigureGreenAppendixA.scr
-------------
compares FD result with analytical result
runtime 80 seconds.

SIrand.scr
----------
Script used to generate the retrieved reflection from passive measurements.

fdelmodc_long.scr
------------
This script is used to model the passive measurements and takes ~100 hours. 

The program to compute the correlation in a continuous way (corrsmp) is missing and the correlation result can not be reproduced. The program corrsmp is still in a development state and not yet suited for release. 

cross.scr and FigureCCsources.scr
----------
used to answer a question of reviewer 3

FigurePres.scr and MakeGifMovie.scr
-------------
Generates snapshots which can be used in a presentation to explain SI
