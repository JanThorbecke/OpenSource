Description of files:


1) model.scr computes the model and the 'basis' shot of R => shot5_rp.su
   - runtime on 4 cores is 4-5 minutes and produces a 3.3 GB data file with 901 shots
2) itertions.scr computes the intermediate results of the multiple attenutation scheme and produces all output files that are used in the manuscript.
   - runtime on 4 cores is 
3) epsPrimaries.scr selected output from step 2) are converted to .eps pictures that are used in the Figures to explain the method.
   To reproduce the postscript files of the manuscript SU postscript plotting programs are required.
-3) epsModel.scr to generate the postscript files for the numerical model

optional scripts not needed to reproduce the figures:
+) primaries.scr computes the internal multiple attenuated (middle) shot record.
   - runtime on 4 cores is ~500 s.
+) primariesPlane.scr: computes the internal moval scheme for plane-waves (see Meles 2020)
+) clean: remove all produced files and start with a clean directory

--------------------------
To reproduce the Figures in the Manuscript:
--------------------------
* Figure 2: Model + Initial wavefield

==> run model.scr to generate the data .su files: this will take 4-5 minutes. The files generate are:
	- hom_cp.su, hom_ro.su
	- model10_cp.su, model10_ro.su
	- shot5_fd_rp.su
	- shot5_hom_fd_rp.su
	- shot5_rp.su
	- wavefw.su

==> run './epsPrimaries.scr Figure2' to generate the postscript files of Figure 2 

model_cp_line.eps 	=> Figure 2a 
model_ro_line.eps 	=> Figure 2b
shotx0_rp.eps 		=> Figure 2c

It also produces two extra pictures of the wavelet used in the FD modelling:
wavefw_freq.eps
wavefw.eps 

--------------------------
* Figure 3: First Iteration

==> run './iterations.scr Figure34910' to compute the intermediate results of the first iterations of the Marchenko Primaries algorithm.
This will take 15 seconds. The generated files are:

	- M0_276000.su
	- Mi_2760##.su
	- k1min_2760##.su
	- v1plus_2760##.su
	- iter_2760##.su (not used)
	- pred_rr_276.su (not used)
	- DDshot_450.su (not used): selected shot record convolved with file_src=wave.su

	where ## ranges from 01 to 33

To generate the postscript files for Figure 3:

==> run './epsPrimaries.scr Figure3' 

This will produce the following files:

shotx0_rp.eps 		=> Figure 2c == Figure 3a
M0_276000_flip.eps	=> Figure 3b
fconvN0fulltime.eps => Figure 3c
fconvN0flip.eps 	=> Figure 3d
Mi_276001.eps		=> Figure 3e


--------------------------
* Figure 4 second iteration
To generate the postscript files for Figure 4:
==> run './epsPrimaries.scr Figure4' 

This will produce the following files:

fconvN1fulltime.eps	=> Figure 4c
fconvN1flip.eps		=> Figure 4d
Mi_276002.eps		=> Figure 4e

The window time function in Figure 5 is not reproduced. 

--------------------------
* Figure 6 v1plus and convergence
==> run './iterations.scr Figure6' to compute the marchenko results with ii=200

To generate the postscript files for Figure 6:

--------------------------
* Figure 8 To compute the convergence for a strong contrast medium:
cd strongContrast
==> run ./model.scr
==> run ./iterations.scr Figure8

To generate the postscript files for Figure 8:
==> run './epsPrimaries.scr Figure8' 

This will produce the following files:
v1plusStrong_max.eps		=> Figure 8

Don't forget to go back to the main directory with the regular contrast results
cd ../

Mi_276001.eps	=> Figure 9a
Mi_276003.eps	=> Figure 9c
Mi_276011.eps	=> Figure 9e

--------------------------
* Figure 10 iterations M_i and k_1^-
