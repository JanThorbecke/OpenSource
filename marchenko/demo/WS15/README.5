To generate the raytimes and the estimated amplitudes for the virtual source and receivers, run in demo/twoD

rayvsp.scr

After the raytimes have been determined you can create the source function of the homogeneous Green's function by running:

marchenko_ray.pbs

A reference Green's function can be modeled by running

homg_reference.scr

To view the retrieved and reference Green's function, run:

homgview.scr

Or to convert the data to eps and png, run:

homgpng.scr
