Marchenko demo/twoD: reproduce the figures from the paper, but with a 2D model.

cd /lus/scratch/$USER/OpenSource/marchenko/demo/twoD

# Copy pre-computed shots
cp -rp /lus/scratch/jan/OpenSource/marchenko/demo/twoD/shots .
cp /lus/scratch/$USER/OpenSource/marchenko/demo/WS15/job.pbs .

Interactively run a progam to create the numerical model used to compute the reference reults.

./model.scr

When that is completed continue by adapting job.pbs to 

Compute the intial focusing operator placed at a depth of 1100 m by running 

initialFocus.scr

To compare the Green's function computed by marchenko generate the reference output

adapt job.pbs to run referenceShot.scr

run the marchenko program interactively (no need to submit job to queue);
 
./marchenko.scr

Compare the Green's function computed by marchenko with the reference (adapt job.pbs to run referenceShot.scr)

The script eps.scr generates .eps and .png files that can be copied back to your local laptop for display.

You can experiment with 
-amplitude of R: scale with a constant ampltiude 
-investigate the wavelet that is used to model R
-number of iterations, 
-intial focusing position, 
-investigate at intermediate results (see ../oneD/marchenkoIter.scr as an example).
