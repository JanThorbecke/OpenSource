Marchenko demo/twoD: reproduce the figures from the paper, but with a 2D model.

cd /lus/scratch/$USER/OpenSource/marchenko/demo/twoD

# Copy pre-computed shots
cp -rp /lus/scratch/jan/OpenSource/marchenko/demo/twoD/shots .
cp /lus/scratch/$USER/OpenSource/marchenko/demo/WS15/job.pbs .

Adapt job.pbs to 

Compute the intial focusing operator placed at a depth of 1100 m by running 

initialFocus.scr

and run the marchenko program
 
marchenko.scr

Compare the Green's function computed by marchenko with the reference (adapt job.pbs to run referenceShot.scr)

You can experiment with 
-number of iterations, 
-intial focusing position, 
-investigate at intermediate results (see ../oneD/marchenkoIter.scr as an example).
