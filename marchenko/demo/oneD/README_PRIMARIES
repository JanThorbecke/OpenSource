Description of files:


1) model.scr computes the model and the 'basis' shot of R => shot5_rp.su
2) p5all.scr create from basis shot full Reflection response matrix => shotsdx5_rp.su (3.3 GB)
3) primaries.scr computes the internal multiple attenuated (middle) shot record.
4) itertions.scr computes the intermediate results of the multiple attenutation scheme and produces all output files that are used in the manuscript.
5) epsPrimaries.scr selected output form 4) are converted to .eps pictures that are used in the Figures to explain the method.
   reproduce the postscript files of the manuscript using SU postscript plotting programs.

extra scripts
+) primariesPlane.scr: computes the internal moval scheme for plane-waves (see Meles 2020)
+) clean: remove all produced files and start with a clean directory

To reproduce the Figures in the Manuscript:

--------------------------
* Figure 2: Model + Initial wavefield

==> run model.scr to generate the data .su files: this will take 3-4 minutes. The files generate are:
	- hom_cp.su, hom_ro.su
	- model10_cp.su, model10_ro.su
	- shot5_fd_rp.su
	- shot5_hom_fd_rp.su
	- shot5_rp.su
	- wave.su
	- wavefw.su

==> run './epsPrimaries.scr Figure2' to generate the postscript files of Figure 2 

model_cp_line.eps 	=> Figure 2a 
model_ro_line.eps 	=> Figure 2b
shotx0_rp.eps 		=> Figure 2c

--------------------------
* Figure 3: First Iteration

The full R matrix is build up from the the shot record computed with model.scr

==> run p5all.scr to generate the full R matrix for a fixed spread geometry. This will take less than one minute. The file generated is
	- shotsdx5_rp.su this file has a size of 3.3 GB

This R is the only input of the Marchenko Primaries algorithm.


==> run marchenkoIter.scr to compute the first 4 iteration of the Marchenko algorithm. This will take 1-2 minutes. The generated files are:
	- p0plus.su
	- pgreen_001.su
	- f1plus_001.su
	- f1min_001.su
	- Gplus_001.su
	- Gmin_001.su
	- pgreen_002.su
	- f1plus_002.su
	- f1min_002.su
	- Gplus_002.su
	- Gmin_002.su
	- pgreen_003.su
	- f1plus_003.su
	- f1min_003.su
	- Gplus_003.su
	- Gmin_003.su
	- pgreen_004.su
	- f1plus_004.su
	- f1min_004.su
	- Gplus_004.su
	- Gmin_004.su

To generate all postscript files for Figure 4, 5 and 6

==> run './epsPrimaries.scr Figure3' to generate the postscript files of Figure 3 

==> run epsMarchenkoIter.scr

shotx0_rp.eps 		=> Figure 4 R == Figure 3c
p0plus.eps	 	=> Figure 4 G_d
iter_001.eps	 	=> Figure 4 N_0

shotx0_rp.eps 		=> Figure 5 R == Figure 3c
f1min_001.eps	 	=> Figure 5 f^-_1,0
iter_002.eps	 	=> Figure 5 -N_1
f1plus_002.eps	 	=> Figure 5 f^+_1,0

Note that the script epsIterwithLabels.scr produces the same figures, but with axis-labels. 

--------------------------
* Figure 7: Comparison of Marchenko result with reference

To compute the marchenko results for 8 iterations.  

==> run marchenko.scr This will take less than 1 minute. The generated files are:
	- pgreen.su, pgreen512.su
	- diffref.su
	- Gplus0.su
	- Gmin0.su
	- f1plus0.su
	- f1min0.su
	- f2.su 


At the end of the run the script will display in X11 a comparison of the middle trace. 

To make the postscript figure 

==> run epsCompare.scr

mergeGreenRef.eps 	=> Figure 7

--------------------------
* Figure 8: snapshots of back propagating f2 in actual medium 

To compute the snapshots 

==> run backpropf2.scr This will take about 1 minute. The generated output file is
	- backpropf2_sp.su

The postscript files of Figure 8 are generated with 

==> run epsBackprop.scr
