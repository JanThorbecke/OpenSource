To generate a shot record with Primaries reflections only submit the demo/twoD/primaries.scr to the queue. 

The script epsPrimaries.scr generates .eps and .png files that can be copied back to your local laptop for display.

The directory demo/invisible contains the Reflection data to analyse:

shotsdx4_rp.su

Try to find out, by ONLY using the program marchenko_primaries, how many reflectors there are.
