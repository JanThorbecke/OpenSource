*1* Source the setup.sh script that you can find on 

source /home/users/jan/WS15setup.sh

The setup.sh script completes the following tasks:

-a-Set PATH to find Seismic Unix and Marchenko code 
export CWPROOT=/home/users/jan/SeisUnix/
export PATH=.:$CWPROOT/bin:/lus/scratch/$USER/OpenSource/bin:$PATH:

-b- Create working directory 
/lus/scratch/$USER

-c- set up compilation environment with the Intel compiler

-d- Get the Marchenko software (and other utilities modeling code))
git clone https://github.com/JanThorbecke/OpenSource.git

if the git clone takes too much time you can copy the source code:

cp -rp /lus/snx11029/jan/OpenSource /lus/scratch/$USER/
 

*2* after the set-up the code can be compiled 

cd OpenSource
cp Make_include_swan Make_include
make clean
make 

After succesfull complication the code can be used for running the exercises and demo's


*3* Running jobs 

To run example jobs must be submitted to the Workload Manager PBSpro.
An example script can be found on:

/lus/scratch/$USER/OpenSource/WS15/job.pbs

in job.pbs leave the number of nodes set to 1; the code is not MPI parallel and cannot use more than 1 node. The number of OMP_NUM_THREADS can be changed and is currently set to 40.
Add the ...scr command (that can be found in the demo directories) as the last line in the aprun command line and submit the job to the queue with 'qsub job.pbs'
you can check the status of your job in the queue with 'qstat'


*4* Display of results:

suximage < result.su perc=99 &

if X11 display is too slow:

supsimage < result.su perc=99 > results.eps
convert results.eps ~/results.png

copy png file to your laptop you are working on

scp trxx@swan.cray.com:~/*png . 


*5* Usefull job monitor commands specific for Cray

apstat : status of applications running
xtnodestat : placement of application on system
xtprocadmin -A : details of installed nodes
