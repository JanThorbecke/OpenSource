\section{\label{migr}migr / migr\_mpi}

\subsection{General}
Shot record migration scheme based on optimized x-w wave field extrapolation operators. 

There is also a parallel version of {\tt migr} called {\tt migr\_mpi}. The parallelisation is based on MPI and the number of shot gathers to be migrated is divided over the number of available working processors. For reading the shot records the master processors reads all the shots and sent the data to the working processors. If a working processor has finished its migration the image (and eventually extrapolated source and receiver wavefields) are communicated back to the master processor, who will write the data to output file(s). 

\subsection{Parameters}
Via the command-line or in a parameter file: {\tt par=$<$parameter\_file$>$}.

  The shot and receiver positions in the model are determined by
  the hdr values gx and sx. The data from file_shot is extrapolated 
  backward, the data from file_src is extrapolated forward.
  If file_src is not set a spike is taken, if file_src=pipe read from stdin
  Note that with the conjg and conjgs options the extrapolation 
  direction can be changed.

\subsection{General parameter description}

The shots to be migrated ({\tt file\_shot}) and the gridded subsurface files ({\tt file\_vel} and {\tt file\_vels}) should have the same lateral extend being defined by the {\tt gx} headers.  The position of the receivers of the data in the subsurface grid is done by means of the {\tt gx} header value of the velocity model corresponding to the {\tt gx} header value in the data to be extrapolated. The distance between the traces in the velocity model should be smaller or equal to the distance between the receivers/shots. The program assigns the {\tt gx} value of the receivers to the nearest grid point in the velocity model. The number of depth steps is controlled with the parameter {\tt ndepth=}. To avoid reflections at the edges of the model the parameter {\tt ntap} can be set. {\tt ntap} indicates the number of points at the edges for which a spatial taper is designed according to: $\exp{(-(0.4*(ntap-ix)/ntap)^2)}$. Choosing {\tt ntap} equal to half of the operator length is an optimimum value. 
 
Topography is taken into account by using a velocity model which has zero velocities above the defined topography. In that case the position of the source and receivers is lowered into the velocity model until a non-zero velocity is found. From that depth the extrapolation of that point is started. 

The parameter {\tt file\_src} describes the source wavelet. If {\tt file\_src} is not defined a band-limited spike is assumed. If {\tt file\_src} contains only one trace it is assumed that this trace is the wavelet used for all shots to be migrated. If {\tt file\_src} contains more than one trace it is interpreted as an areal shot record and areal short-record migration is carried out. 

The parameters {\tt ixa} and {\tt ixb} determine the number of traces to be included in the calculation of a image gather. 
{\tt ixa} defines the number of traces to include in the calculation with a lateral position greater than the lateral extend (max value of {\tt sx,gx}) of the shot gather ({\tt a} from after). 
{\tt ixb} defines the number of traces to include in the calculation with a lateral shot position smaller than the lateral extend (max value of {\tt sx,gx}) of the shot gather ({\tt b} from before).


For a more detailed discussion on the different parameters which are related to the extrapolation operator optimization the reader is referred to the description of the program \htmlref{{\bf opercalc}}{opercalc}. The WLSQ operators are described in Thorbecke et al. (2004).
